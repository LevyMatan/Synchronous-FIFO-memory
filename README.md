> SystemVerilog Synchronous FIFO Memory  

Implementention in SystemVerilog of __synchronous FIFO memory__.  

## Get Started

The source files  are located at the repository root:

- [Synchronous_FIFO_TB](./Synchronous_FIFO_TB.sv)
- [Synchronous_FIFO](./Synchronous_FIFO.sv)


### Possible Applications

Implementation of the synchronous FIFO memory in a complete UART module can be found in the [following repository]((./Synchronous_FIFO.sv))

## Support

I will be happy to answer any questions.
